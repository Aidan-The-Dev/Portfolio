            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From my first lines of JavaScript to diving into HTML, CSS, and back-end development, my journey in tech has been fueled by curiosity. I am always learning new technologies, tools, and frameworks to stay up-to-date and create cutting-edge solutions.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy gaming, listening to music, and moderating Discord servers. These hobbies often inspire my creative problem-solving approach and help me stay motivated to push boundaries in my projects.</p>
            <p>Currently, my main hobby is the Digital Thunderbirds where I am #8 The Narrator and Advance Pilot, I'm also currently working on making a new website for the team which can be found in my Projects.</p>

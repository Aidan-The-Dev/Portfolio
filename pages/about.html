        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Aidan White, an 18-year-old full-stack developer from the United States. I began coding at the age of 11, starting with JavaScript, and later diving into HTML and CSS. Today, I create websites and discord bots.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in the power of web development to bring ideas to life. My goal is to make websites that not only look good but also serve a meaningful purpose. Well-designed websites can enhance how people interact with the digital world, and that's what drives my passion for web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy gaming and listening to music. These interests often inspire my creative solutions and ideas in coding projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also a Discord server moderator, honing my interpersonal and problem-solving skills while fostering positive online communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology is ever-evolving, and I'm determined to contribute to its transformation. Whether it's a personal project or a client's, my work reflects my dedication, attention to detail, and a constant desire to improve.
        </p>
        <p>
